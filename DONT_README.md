there's nothing to read about, really
it's just an empty file, okay?
even though it might seem that there are some symbols
and you can percieve their meaning, but
there's nothing to percieve and that's
why it's fair to say that this file is totaly empty,
despite that some may promote the opposite idea
don't listen to those who do! they know not what
they're talking about for they're blind!
trust me, after all i'm the one who wrote
nothing in this file. or don't. it's okay
to have a different view, even if in the end
you learn that you've been fooled.
at least you learnt something, right?
wrong. you could if you read something else cause,
you know, there's nothing to read here, so
why d'you keep reading? or should i ask
why d'you keep staring at empty screen?
d'you expect a pun or d'you expecto patronum!
but siriusly i'm not a comedian. or a wizard
no puns, no spells - that's my motto
i would write it down, but i didn't
well, since you went so far at reading this
empty file, like nobody else ever did
cause there's nothing to read and it's empty,
you 'member? however, since you're here
i might as well tell you a secret or even not
anywhores, it's time to stop fooling around
and get to the main point of all this. listen
there's nothing to read about, really
it's just an empty file, okay?
even though it might seem that it repeats itself
and you have read that piece earlier
it couldn't be true, cause it's empty
you wouldn't happen to be a psychic of some sort,
would you? if so, you should immediatly quit reading
cause i don't believe in you! neither do i believe
that there's something in this file that
you could read. d'you really still hope to find something
like the answer to the question of life, universe, etc.?
in a random empty file that was never written?
well, it's probably the best place to look for something
like that, but it's just not this particular empty file
keep looking! elsewhere. i believe in you, 'course
if you're not a psychic or writings in this file
well, is there a good way to end this? probably.
if i knew one, i'd write it down in this file, but
you see... i didn't write a word in this file
